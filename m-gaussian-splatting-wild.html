    Official GS-W implementation - 3DGS modified to handle appearance changes and transient objects. A reference view used to provide appearance conditioning. Note, that the method uses huge appearance embeddings (per-Gaussian) and appearance modeling has a large memory footprint.

        Photo Tourism
      </h2>
      <p class="text-justify">Photo Tourism is a dataset of images of famous landmarks, such as the Sacre Coeur, the Trevi Fountain, and the Brandenburg Gate. The images were captured by tourist at different times of the day and year, images have varying lighting conditions and occlusions. The evaluation protocol is based on NeRF-W, where the image appearance embeddings are optimized on the left side of the image and the metrics are computed on the right side of the image.</p>
